            Hi Clariz,
        </p>

        <p>
            Happy Belated Valentine's Day! I just wanted to take a moment to tell you how much I like you as a person.
        </p>

        <p>
            Although we have yet to meet more in the future, I feel like this could be the gift I can give you for now. I hope you like it!
            

        <p>
            I know you're still busy in school, but i will support you from afar for now. Just to not let my presence be a distraction for you. I hope that we can meet more in the future, and i hope that we can have fun together in the future as well.
        </p>
