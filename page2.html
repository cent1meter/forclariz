        <p>
            Hi Clariz,
        </p>

        <p>
            Happy Belated Valentine's Day! I just wanted to take a moment to tell you how much I like you as a person.
        </p>

        <p>
           I like the way you are as a person, your looks, your personality, your hardworking nature (self glaze), and how you carry yourself. this is all I know for now, but I’m sure there’s so much more to discover in the future.
        </p>

        <p>
            I know you're still busy in school at the moment, but i will support you from in any way i can. I hope that we can meet more and have fun together in the future as well.
        </p>
